      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>The HomeLand Furniture Decorators, is a furniture firm that is located at Nakuru City,Kenlands Street.
        And since the website was purposefully coded for academics and not for any other reason, the firm does't 
        exist at the first place.And therefore, its an idea of the genius mind to code.</p>
